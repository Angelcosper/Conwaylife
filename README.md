# Project Title

Conway's game of life prediction machine.

## Summary

This project is intended to be a programme that generates setups of 256 by 256 matrices of randomly generated 0s and 1s and transforms them step by step following conway's game of life. Then, using artificial intelligence, these matrices and their output matrices after say 2048 or 4096 cycles are fed to a computer in order to predict if any given 256 by 256 matrix of 1s and 0s will come to a halt before any given number of transformation cycles.


## Background

More on Conway's game of life here:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life 


## How is it used?


## Data sources and AI methods

## Challenges

The model cannot and will not predict the behavior of a setup at infinite time, due to it being turing-complete.

## What next?
